          <span class="caption text-muted">Skeleton Shrimp (Caprella Californica)</span>
          <p>Skeleton shrimp are tiny, nearly see through <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphipoda">amphipods</a> that grow from 1/2 an inch to 2 inches in length. They have six hooked back legs covered whith little hairs which help them grip onto vegetation, hydroids, and sponges against the current. They use their front legs to capture food such as <a target="blank_" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copepod">copepods</a>, algae, and detritus. Females carry transparent eggs in the brooding pouch on their abdomen.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">Aggregating Anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima)</span>
          <p>Aggregating anemones are one of the three types of anemones found in the intertidal zone of Bodega Bay. They can grow to about 3.5 inches wide and feed on copepods,<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isopoda">isopods</a>, and amphipods, which they kill using stinging cells on their tentacles. They rely on microscopic algae for their green color and food supply and in return provide the algae with the right amount of light. When exposed to air they close up and sticky bumps on their outside collect rocks to help them blend in and not dry out.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">Acorn Barnacle (Semibalanus balanoides)</span>
          <p>Acorn barnacles are sessile, meaning they can't move, crustaceans that are found on rocky shores. They surround themselves with a shell that provides protection from predators and lets them trap some water so that they won't dry out during low tide. Using their legs they filter feed plankton and other particles from the water. They grow about 1/2 inch and attach directly to the substrate, unlike <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose_barnacle">gooseneck barnacles</a>, which use a stalk to attach.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">Ochre Sea Star (Pisaster ochraceus)</span>
          <p>Ochre sea stars are found on rocky shores in shallow water from Alaska to Baja California. They grow from 10 to 18 inches and can be yellow, purple, orange, brown, or reddish. They can also live up to 20 years of age. Their anatomy is simple since they have no brain, just nerves that direct movement. Theses sea stars use their tube feet to handle prey such as mussels, chitons, and limpets so that their stomach can be everted over the prey to digest it. It retracts sensitive parts of itself when predators like sea otters and gulls attack.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">California Mussel (Mytilus californianus)</span>
          <p>California mussels feed under water by opening their shells slightly and using cilia to draw in water which has detritus and plankton. Predators such as crabs, sea stars, and lobsters eat them, leaving room on the rocks for other species. They use fibers called byssal threads to attach to rocks and can move by breaking old threads and placing new ones after moving around on their foot. They grow to their full size of 5 inches in about three years.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">Black Turban Snail (Tegula funebralis)</span>
          <p>Black turban snails can be found along the west coast of North America, from British Colombia to Mexico. Their distinctly colored black shells grow to about 3 centimeters and once abandoned, may be adopted by hermit crabs. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottia_asmi">Black limpets</a> that feed on microalgae and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.centralcoastbiodiversity.org/hooked-slippersnail-bull-crepidula-adunca.html">slippersnails</a> will often grow on the turban snails. Males and females can be distinguished by the color of their foot sole, since males typically have a paler one. Black turban snails can also live up to 80-100 years.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">Pacific Purple Sea Urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus)</span>
          <p>Purple sea urchins live in shallow areas of water that are abundant in kelp along the Pacific Coast. They have a mouth with five teeth underneath them that helps them easily eat kelp and they excrete waste through the top of their body. They have several small tube feet that help them move around. They also have spikes, which serve as a way to help them move as well as protection from predators such as <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiny_lobster">spiny lobsters</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_sheephead">sheep-head fish</a>, and sea otters.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">Shield Back Kelp Crab (Pugettia producta)</span>
          <p>Shield back kelp crabs are found in kelp beds as well as in tide pools with surfgrass or algae along the Pacific coast from Baja California to Alaska. The color of the crab depends on the type of algae that they eat, providing them with better camouflage. When the crab reached sexual maturity it will undergo its final molt and soon after females will carry eggs for several months. Kelp crabs are nocturnal vegeterians and eat primarily bull kelp, sea cabbage, and rockweed but if they need to they'll also eat barnacles and mussels.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Thinking of Going Tidepooling?</h2>

          <p><h3>Make sure to:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Wear rain boots or shoes that will keep water out</li>
              <li>Wear warm clothes (especially if you are going early in the morning)</li>
              <li>Check when low tide will be and go at that time (you'll want to avoid high tide)</li>
              <li>Bring a bucket or other container if you want to collect animals</li>
              <li>Go with at least one other person who can make sure waves don't sneak up on you</li>
